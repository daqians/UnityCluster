# UnityCluster
This project is for people who wants to learn Parallel Rendering by using Unity3D.This fuction is different from the srceen linking by Screen splicing and SAGE2.It is a new idea to link multiscreens by using Network View component in Unity3D.
Hardware is combine by WIFI network,five 4K screens,an android smartphone,Leap Motion and 5 CPUs.
Cluster Package is the main component in this project.I also add some other fuctions to elevate the effect of display.Like AR modle display in Android phone and Leap Motion.
