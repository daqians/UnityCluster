# UnityCluster

This project is for people who wants to learn Parallel Rendering by using Unity3D.This fuction is different from the srceen linking by Screen splicing and SAGE2.

This is a new idea to link multiscreens by using Network View component in Unity3D.

Hardware is combined by WIFI network,five 4K screens,an android smartphone,Leap Motion and 5 CPUs.

'Cluster Package' is the main component in this project.

I have also added some other fuctions to elevate the effect of display.Like AR modle display in Android phone and Leap Motion.
